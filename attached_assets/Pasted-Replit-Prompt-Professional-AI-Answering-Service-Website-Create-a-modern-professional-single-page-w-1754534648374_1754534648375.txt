Two Call Examples Side by Side:
Call 1 - URGENT (Highlighted in Red)

Caller: "Hi, I have water pouring through my ceiling from upstairs. It's flooding my living room!"
AI Response: "I understand this is an emergency. Let me get your information immediately and have someone contact you within 15 minutes."
AI Action: Flags as URGENT, sends immediate alert to on-call plumber, creates high-priority lead
Result: "Emergency plumber dispatched - Potential revenue: $800-2,000"

Call 2 - NON-URGENT (Highlighted in Blue)

Caller: "My kitchen faucet has been dripping for a few weeks. Can someone take a look next week?"
AI Response: "I can definitely help schedule a service appointment. What days work best for you?"

Result: "Appointment scheduled for Tuesday - Potential revenue: $150-400"
